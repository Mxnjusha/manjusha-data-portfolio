# 🌧️ Climate Expenditure Forecast – Landslides in India

This project explores government spending on landslides caused by extreme monsoons across India from 2015 to 2023.

It examines rainfall data, volume of landslides, damaged area, and financial aid provided. Using regression techniques, the model forecasts future climate-related expenditures and proposes strategies for risk mitigation in vulnerable regions like Wayanad and Mullaperiyar.
